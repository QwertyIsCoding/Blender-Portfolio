This is the text file where I will be adding new posts so that I can add them to sites. This is a temporary solution will I figure out a way to automatially fetch tweets that are related to my Blender renders and display them in the site. This makes the site "dyna-static" which means it is sort of dynamic but still static. This idea of mine is still udner development(research is taking most of the time) and am trying out simpler alternatives that work better. If you have suggestions, please mention them by emailing me or using the discussions section. Or, if you would like to contribute, make a fork of this repository and make a PR!
