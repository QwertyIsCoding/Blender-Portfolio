# Blender-Portfolio
## About the project
>This is a Blender portfolio where I can just showcase all my renders. But, just so you know, none of these images should be re-licensed or something of that sort. And DO NOT TRY TO REMOVE THE WATERMARK AND PASS IT OFF AS YOUR OWN.

>TESTING

There is also a testing branch where I test features out before publishing it to the final website. Again, the GitHub pages site is the most frequently updates site(in terms of features and testing) whereas the final version will be hosted on Netlify.
