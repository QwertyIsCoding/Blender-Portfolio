# Blender-Portfolio
>This is the code for my Blender portfolio. 

>For the quickest updates, check out the GitHub pages build in environments.

>The theme was created by imfunniee and is called Fimbo(site 2) but has been modified *heavily*.

>The netlify build will be done every month. This way, development is steady and the live build will be regularly up to date.

>TESTING

There is also a testing branch where I test features out before publishing it to the final website. Again, the GitHub pages site is the most frequently updates site(in terms of features and testing) whereas the final version will be hosted on Netlify.
