## About the project
>This is a Blender portfolio where I can showcase all my renders. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

>This is the code for my Blender portfolio. 

>For the quickest updates, check out the GitHub pages build in environments. The Netlify deployment is depreciated and I've moved it over to Floudflare Pages which has automatic deployments and will update within 3-5 minutes of the most recent update.

>The theme was created by imfunniee and is called Fimbo(site 2) but has been modified *heavily*.

>MEDIA

>I currently have all the media off Twitter and it's easier for me to manage that way but the resolutions are absolutely tiny and compression just makes it worse. So, I'm planning to upload my renders to this branch but I want to make it so that the site's visitor can't right click and open the image in a new tab or copy the URL... so till then I'm gonna use the Twitter way since copying the file is useless since it so low rez
