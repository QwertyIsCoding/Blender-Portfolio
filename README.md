# Blender-Portfolio
## About the project
>This is a Blender portfolio where I can showcase all my renders. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

>This is the code for my Blender portfolio. 

>For the quickest updates, check out the GitHub pages build in environments. The Netlify deployment is depreciated and I've moved it over to Floudflare Pages which has automatic deployments and will update within 3-5 minutes of the most recent update.

>The theme was created by imfunniee and is called Fimbo(site 2) but has been modified *heavily*.

>TESTING

There is also a testing branch where I test features out before publishing it to the final website. Again, the GitHub pages site is the most frequently updates site(in terms of features and testing) whereas the final version will be hosted on Netlify.
