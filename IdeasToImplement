This is the text file where I will be adding new posts so that I can add them to sites. This is a temporary solution will I figure out a way to automatially fetch tweets that are related to my Blender renders and display them in the site. This makes the site "dyna-static" which means it is sort of dynamic but still static. This idea of mine is still udner development(research is taking most of the time) and am trying out simpler alternatives that work better. If you have suggestions, please mention them by emailing me or using the discussions section. Or, if you would like to contribute, make a fork of this repository and make a PR!

So I did find a solution but this is *very* primitive... It is to use a script(let's say hosted on Heroku) that scans the Twitter page to see if there's a '#blender' hashtag which will then sort it out base don the date and list it on the site so you can see my most recent renders. The only problem now is to fugure out how to make everthing work on the fly because I am using GitHub pages and Netlify for the most part to host the site and they both are static web hosting services so I can't run a script(as far as I know) so. Figuring out how to link heroku and pages would be nice and I am gonna figure that out in a while so. Yeaah. Anyway, if you still have a better solution then try contacting me via email or Discord! 
 
So I now have a "Media" branch where I can easily commit new renders and it will be in the Git repo. So now, instead of finding it from Twitter, I have to make it look from the branch. The advantage for this is that I can have higher rez renders on the website and I need to work on the "dynamic" image loading thing anyway so it all works out.

It runs on Cloudflare now so I think I can run scripts
